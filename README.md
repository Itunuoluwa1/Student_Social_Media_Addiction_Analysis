### Q2‚ÄìQ7. Behavioral and Academic Patterns  

**Key insights from the Power BI dashboard:**  
- **Avg Daily Usage:** 4.92 hours per student.  
- **Avg Addiction Score:** 6.44 (moderate‚Äìhigh addiction).  
- **Avg Mental Health Score:** 6.23 (slightly below healthy threshold).  
- **Avg Sleep Hours:** 6.87 hours per night.  
- **Academic Impact:** 64.3% of students believe social media negatively affects their academic performance. I got this using the DAX function:
```DAX
% Affected Academically = 
FORMAT(
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(Students_Social_Media_Addiction, Students_Social_Media_Addiction[Affects_Academic_Performance] = "Yes")),
        COUNTROWS(Students_Social_Media_Addiction), 0),
        "0.0%"
)
```
**Additional Observations:**  
- High school students show the highest addiction score (7.50), followed by undergraduates (6.54).  
- Single students exhibit the highest addiction levels (6.60), while those in relationships report slightly lower scores (6.04).
